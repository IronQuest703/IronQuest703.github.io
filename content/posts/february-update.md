Welcome back for the February monthly update on my quest to become an Ironman by the end of 2026.

## Overall Progression
The plot displays the accumulation of TRIMP (Training Impulse) over time, illustrating how training load evolves throughout a selected period. The histogram represents daily or weekly TRIMP values, providing insight into the intensity and volume of training sessions. Superimposed on the histogram, a line graph tracks the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR), which compares short-term (acute) training load to long-term (chronic) training load.

To account for different scales, TRIMP values are plotted on the primary y-axis, while the ACWR is mapped to the secondary y-axis, typically ranging between 0 and 2. This visualization helps assess training balanceâ€”a stable ACWR (around 1.0) suggests well-managed workload, whereas spikes may indicate overtraining risks or insufficient load.

This combined view enables coaches and athletes to monitor training progression and optimize workload distribution for improved performance and injury prevention.

## Swimming
This section is the one that is giving me the most satisfaction lately. I started as absolute beginner and I decided to invest a significant part of my budget to 

## Cycling 
My Cycling training hasn't started yet; temperatures in Luxembourg just started to rise above zero.
